# Huffman Coding Compression

## 📜 Project Overview
This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm. The goal is to analyze and optimize text compression by constructing Huffman trees, calculating entropy, and comparing compression efficiency with ASCII encoding.

The project uses a Python script to:
- Read text from a `.docx` file.
- Compute character frequencies and probabilities.
- Build a Huffman tree and generate Huffman codes.
- Calculate entropy and compression efficiency.
- Compare Huffman encoding with standard ASCII encoding.

## 🚀 Features
- **Lossless compression** using Huffman Coding.
- **Entropy calculation** to evaluate compression efficiency.
- **Comparison with ASCII encoding** to measure compression performance.
- **Table representation** of frequencies, probabilities, and Huffman codes.
- **Compression percentage calculation**.

## 📊 Results
- The Huffman coding achieved **~47.27% compression** compared to ASCII encoding.
- Entropy calculations were close to theoretical limits, proving efficiency.
- Shorter codes were assigned to more frequent characters, ensuring optimal compression.

## 📚 Theoretical Background
Huffman coding is a **greedy algorithm** used for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length binary codes to input symbols based on their frequency of occurrence.


Compression efficiency is evaluated by comparing:
- **Fixed-length ASCII encoding** (8 bits per character)
- **Variable-length Huffman coding** (adaptive bit allocation)
